# Statitistical_modeling_Final_Project

Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that affects both motor and cognitive function, corresponding to the leading cause of dementia. Since there is no alternative capable of reversing the initial pathological changes associated with the disease, early diagnosis proves advantageous. It helps maintain for longer the patient's functional level, enhancing their quality of life given proper access to treatments and resources (Rasmussen & Langerman, 2019). 

Handwriting alterations serve as an early identifiable symptom and a marker of disease onset or progression. Therefore, using handwriting skills to predict a patient's condition is a rational approach in preventing and delaying the disease and subsequent dementia, which becomes increasingly critical considering the global rise in life expectancy.

The input for our algorithms comprises measurements obtained from handwriting samples of both Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy people included in the DARWIN dataset. The aim is to predict whether an individual is affected by Alzheimer and to retrieve the most predictive tasks and features for the identification of said disease. In line with this purpose, the ongoing project uses penalized regressions such as LASSO and Ridge regression, logistic regression using Principal Components and clustering with Gaussian mixture modelling to predict our binary outcome.

The paper aims to contribute to the existing literature by evaluating the success of the aforementioned statistical modelling techniques in capturing the distinctive aspects of handwriting that support the diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
